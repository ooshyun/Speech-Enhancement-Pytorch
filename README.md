# Deep Learning model for Speech Separation / Speech Enhancement

This repository is for desiging and training Deep Learning(DL) model for Speech Separation/Speech Enhancement originally for [2023 Clarity Challenge](https://claritychallenge.org). It used in [2023 Clarity Challenge framework](https://github.com/ooshyun/ClarityChallenge2023), and also can train/evaluate DL Models. Before the main contents, the naming source is from [denoiser](https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoiser)

## Model Design

DL models are for single channel, single sources, and multi-speakers Speech Separation. Each model has a property of dataset, which tested in model/model_name.py main part. Each of models are from implementations from other repository whose some of them are modified for its target parameters. The list of models are as below,

### Library 
- If want to analyze with amplified signal, then refers https://github.com/ooshyun/ClarityChallenge2023
- This library is for RTK3090
    - pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    - pyyaml==6.0
    - julius==0.2.7
    - librosa==0.9.2
    - tqdm==4.64.1
    - matplotlib==3.6.3
    - tensorboard==2.11.2
    - torchmetrics==0.5.1
    - pesq==0.0.4
    - pypesq==1.2.4
    - pystoi==0.3.3
    - museval==0.4.0
    - pynvml==11.4.1
    - typing

- It tested MacOS and Linux with RTK3090. When testing MacOS, it only change pytoch verion

- The difference is  torch 1.13.1 and torch 1.7.1, which makes torch.concat and torch.cat function.


### Result
- Currenlty, it denoised as below wav file, but still contiute to training.

- Wavform
